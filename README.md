# Lantern Van Requester

As our final project for [the Google J-Term / Applied CS program](https://appliedcsskills.withgoogle.com), we created an app to facilitate student requests for Lantern Van rides around campus and select off-campus locations.

## App Images

When the app is first run, the default screen prompts the user for a pickup and dropoff location.
